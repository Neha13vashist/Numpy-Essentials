# Numpy Concepts Notebook

This Jupyter Notebook covers various fundamental concepts of Numpy (Numerical Python) and demonstrates their applications in data analysis. Numpy is a powerful library for numerical computations in Python.

## Concepts Covered

The notebook covers the following Numpy concepts:

1. **Introduction to Numpy**
   - Explanation of Numpy and its importance in data science.

2. **Creating Numpy Arrays**
   - Demonstrates how to create Numpy arrays from lists and other data structures.
   
3. **Array Shape and Dimensions**
   - Discusses the shape and dimensions of Numpy arrays.

4. **Indexing and Slicing**
   - Explains how to access and manipulate elements within Numpy arrays.

5. **Universal Functions (ufunc)**
   - Introduces universal functions and their applications in element-wise operations.

6. **Aggregate Functions**
   - Covers aggregation functions like sum(), mean(), min(), and max().

7. **Reshaping and Resizing**
   - Explains how to reshape and resize Numpy arrays.

8. **Matrix Operations**
   - Demonstrates matrix multiplication and vectorization using Numpy.

9. **Broadcasting**
    - Discusses broadcasting rules in Numpy for performing operations on arrays of different shapes.

10. **Dimension Expansion and Reduction**
    - Explains dimension expansion and reduction techniques.

11. **Shallow Copy vs. Deep Copy**
    - Covers the concepts of shallow copy and deep copy in Numpy arrays.

12. **Array Splitting and Merging**
    - Demonstrates techniques for splitting and merging Numpy arrays.

13. **Logical Operations**
    - Explains logical operations on Numpy arrays, including 'where' and 'any' functions.

14. **Sorting and Argsorting**
    - Covers sorting and argsorting functions in Numpy.

15. **Broadcasting Rules**
    - Detailed explanation of broadcasting rules with examples.

16. **Additional Examples and Exercises**
    - Includes additional examples for better understanding.
